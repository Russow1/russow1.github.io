		<h2>Ten Steps to Isolating Yourself From Humanity</h2>
		<p class="sis">This is something my sister had written back when she was in highschool for a english project. I figure it would be fitting since I am again<br> using this
		idea for a project (with her permission of course) please keep in mind this was written about 7 years ago so it is a little dated.</p>
		<h2 id="P"></h2>

		<div class="border"><ul>
      
			<li>You are better then everyone, and everything- <strong>period</strong>
			<li>Who cares?
			<li>Snide comments are key
			<li>Tight pants
			<li>Pretenchus music and hair
			<li>Never attentive in class(you have something better to do)
			<li>Disobay every rule you come across
			<li>Like animals more than people(vegan?)
			<li>Crowd places outside of school(town, mall)
			<li>You probably wouldn't follow these directions anyway because you're too cool to admit it
			</ul></div>

		<p>I think walking into highschool everyone who wasnt popular expects it to be similar to the movies. You expect the groups to be secluded, that the jocks wouldn't be as smart and the geeks wouldn't be as </p>
		<ul>
			<li> Jocks
			<li> Goths
			<li> Loners
			<li> Stoners
			<li> Geeks
			
		</ul>
